Brainchop
===========

Brainchop is a client-side web-application  for automatic segmentation of MRI volumes that brings automatic volumetric  segmentation    capability to neuroimaging  by running a robustly pre-trained deep learning model. The app does not require technical sophistication from the user and is designed for  locally and privately segmenting userâ€™s T1 volumes.  Results of the segmentation may be easily saved locally after the computation. An intuitive interactive interface that does not require any special training nor specific instruction to run enables access to a state of the art deep learning brain segmentation for anyone with a modern browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome etc) and commonly available hardware. Additionally, we make implementation of brainchop freely available releasing its pure Javascript code as open-source.
